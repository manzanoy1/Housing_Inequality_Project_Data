"""My findings about the correlation between blacks, hispanics and whites were these numbers: 
> black_females [1] 0.3331051
> black_males [1] 0.1564387
> hispanic_females [1] 0.1723616
> hispanic_males [1] 0.03114569
> white_females [1] 0.1992209
> white_males [1] 0.1344638
It really seems that black females have more mobility from the lower income families than the rest of the six demographic groups."""
